## <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/idea-1618744-1372450.png" width="32" height="32"> Abstract
Licensr is a one stop application for licenese generation, transfer and authentication using blockchain technology. The plan is to issue licenses as NFTs which can be transferred to consumer's wallets and proper authentication can be ensured. The client company can issue any number of License tokens according to their need and sell them to their consumers. We plan to aprovide an API which will recieve the License token address and a wallet address and send a response if the token belongs to the given address. This implementation will greatly reduce software piracy and will provide an easy way to handle licenses. This also has an added advantage that the licenses can be resold by the customers and retail of products will become much easier. The company can set commission rates for resales and earn passive income easily.

Software Piracy is a common problem in many companies. The idea of Licensr being completely Blockchain based makes it different.
Issuing Licenses as NFTs is a never thought of before idea.
Since the Blockchain is unhackable and untamperable, our idea solves the issues of software piracy for all softwares.

2. They can select the amount of licenses they want and generate it simply
3. Our Smart Contract will mint Licenses as NFTs(unique to oneself) for the company
4. The minted license can be verified from the consumers end with our api from which we will authenticate the user of the software.
5. If authorized, user is permitted to use the software.
6. And it's done!By this we have solved the problem of Software Piracy.

The idea can further be extended to protect things like Audio, Video, Photos of independent artists which get stolen easily nowadays.

For our Business Model, we plan to charge a small amount of commission from our client in return for the services we provide.
